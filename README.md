# Printing Hex Number efficiently on AVR CPUs

I was playing with the idea of using ASM to save a few bytes of code for arduino.
The simple task was to write a routine that prints hex numbers via the serial interface.

I am saving all steps and disassembly if someone wants to look. I also added clock cycle counter by hand. If you find any mistakes - pleas say so!
